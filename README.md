# Decaf Compiler

This was a semester-long project, for my compilers course, to build a compiler for the simple programming language "Decaf". This project is originally based on a project from course 6.035 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It was composed of 5 subproject submissions throughout the semester, and was done in pairs of two. Each subproject focused a separate phases from the compiler cycle: lexical, syntax, semantic, intermediate code generation, optimization, and code generation. The last two phases were combined in the final subproject.

### Subprojects: <br>
>Project 1: Decaf Lexer<br>
Project 2: Decaf Parser<br>
Project 3: Static Analysis<br>
Project 4: Code Generation<br>
Project 5: Register Allocation<br>
<br>

### Some skills demonstrated in projects: <br>
<ul>
  <li>analyze formal descriptions of computer languages</li>
  <li>apply finite automata theory to build recognizers (lexers) for regular languages</li>
  <li>apply pushdown automata theory to build recognizers (parsers) for context-free grammars</li>
  <li>implement visitor design pattern to evalute syntax and semantics using types and type systems in static analysis subproject</li>
  <li>perform tree traversals to convert a syntax tree to low-level code</li>
  <li>consider the limitations that an architecture or execution enviornment places on generation of machine code</li>
</ul>
